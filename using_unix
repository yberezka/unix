Once inside the Terminal, you can have an account that gives you access to:
 
   A. MAX OS X Filesystem
A file = unit of storage and it can hold anything from text to a digitally encoded sound
Files are organised into directories aka a special kind of file where the system stores information about other files

  B. Username that identfies you & lets you control files 
 
  C. Customized environment 
  
1. Home Directory: also known as a login directory
2. Working Directory or Current Directory 
3. Parent Directory or Root Directory (can be written as / and can contain multiple subdirectories): it can contain several other directories such as 'User', 'System' etc. these are known as subdirectories.

  You can use pathways to specify a directory location. Pathways can be absolute or relative.
    - Absolute: always begins with / 
    - Relative: specifies location relative to your working directory
    
 Useful commands:
   $pwd     - present working directory
   $cd      - current working directory
