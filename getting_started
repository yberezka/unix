What is Operating System (OS)?

A control program for a computer, which allocates computer resources and schedules tasks. Computer resources inlcude: central processing unit(CPU),
system memory, disk, tape storage, printers, terminals, modems & pretty much anything else connected to the computer. OS provides you with an
interface to access computer resources. 

What is Unix?

1. Multi-user operating system which allows multiple users to use the computer resources at a time. 
2. Direct commmunication with the computer - via Terminal.
3. Ability to share data & programs among multiple users.

Where do I find Unix?

Finder -> Application -> Utilities -> Terminal 
(OR command + space and type Terminal)

Anything else?

Inside the Terminal, you will be working with a program known as 'shell'. 
Shell supports the interaction between yourself & the Unix OS.
There are different types of Shell. To check which one you have:
   $echo $SHELL
   
What is the format for Unix?

Unix accepts arguments. An argument is either an option or a filename. Therefore the general format for a Unix command line is:
  [command options(s) filename(s)]
  
where

  [command]     - lowercase
  [option(s)]   - modifies the way a command works. Options are usually single letters prefixed with a hyphen (-). Some commands also have options made from full words but with two hyphens (--) such as --confirm-delete
  [filename(s)] - the name of a file
  
Types of Commands:

  1. Graphical 
  2. Non-interactive
  3. Interactive

   $who am i       - displays current account using Terminal
   $date           - displays current date
   $exit           - exit the Terminal
   $open -a Chess  - opens the Chess game/can replace Chess with any other program

   $ls -a          - displays list of files + hidden files 
   $ls -al         - displays list of files and hidden files with additional information
   
Command .    - moves on a new line & whatever you have typed will not be executed
