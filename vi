There are 3 popular Unix editors:

1. vi (all Unix systems have it)
2. Pico (great choice for simple editing)
3. Emacs (also widely used)

How to create a new directory?
  $ mkdir projectA  - creates Project A directory
  $ mkdir projectA projectB - creates Project A and Project B directory (just add space to add multiple directories)
  

Vi editor has two important modes: 
  command mode: moves cursor, deletes texts, copies, pastes, saves files etc.
  insert mode: insert texts & characters.
  
  if you are in insert mode, ESC will move you back to command mode.

To create a new file in VI:
   $ vi hello - create a new file called hello
   $ :q       - exit vi 
   $ :q!      - force quit
   $ :w       - write any changes to the file
   $ :wq      - write and quit (OR ZZ does the same thing)
  
   
Useful shortcuts:
H       - move your mouse to the first line of text
G       - move your mouse to the bottom line of text
