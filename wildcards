Careful....its wildcards!

If you have a number of files in a directory that startes with same characters, this might help:

    * aka Asterisk:
    typing al* will return alerie, aleon, alson etc
    typing .??* will return all files with dot
    
   ? aka Qustion Mark:
   this stands for any single character 
   typing b?e will return bye, bee etc.
   
   [] aka Square Brackets provides many options:
   - [Hh]ello will return Hello and hello 
   - hello[12] will return hello1, hello2
   - adding a hyphen will help with consecutive ranges. hello[1-20] will return hello1....hello20.
   
Wildcards can also be used with directories - by adding them in a pathway (absolute or relative).
